# Secure SDLC Integration Case Study

## üß† Type: Portfolio Project (Simulated Case Study)

---

### üßæ Overview

This project is a **portfolio case study** where I explored how to improve a software company‚Äôs security posture by integrating a **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)**. 

The case study focuses on a fictional SaaS company called *CodeSecure Innovations* that handles sensitive client data and is facing challenges with compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001), increasing security incidents, and a lack of secure development practices.

The goal of this simulation was to design a security-first development environment that proactively embeds security into every stage of the software lifecycle.

### üéØ Project Objective

To simulate the transformation of a reactive, vulnerability-prone SDLC into a **proactive, secure, and compliance-ready SSDLC** ‚Äî focusing on:

- Reducing risk exposure
- Enhancing compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Promoting a culture of "security by design"

---

### üß© My Approach

#### 1. üîç Gap Analysis
- Assessed a fictional ‚Äúcurrent state‚Äù of SDLC
- Highlighted issues like lack of pre-deployment security testing, poor developer awareness, and phishing vulnerabilities

#### 2. üõ† SSDLC Framework Design
- Created mock policies: Secure Coding, AppSec Testing, and Requirements Definition
- Included practices like SAST, DAST, strong encryption, MFA, and code repository hygiene

#### 3. üîß Tooling & Developer Enablement
- Recommended tools for secure development (CI/CD integration, scanning tools)
- Proposed developer security training initiatives (anti-phishing, secure coding)

#### 4. üìà Governance & Continuous Improvement
- Suggested KPIs (e.g., phishing click rate reduction, training participation)
- Emphasized periodic updates, policy reviews, and secure dev process automation

---

### ‚úÖ Outcomes (Simulated)

- A complete mock SSDLC framework blueprint
- Demonstrated understanding of secure DevOps integration
- Reinforced governance and risk management practices across dev environments
- Increased readiness for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance (in theory)
